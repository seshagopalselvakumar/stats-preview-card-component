## Overview
This is a challenge hosted on Frontend Mentor. The task is to make use to the design available and code the same and make sure it is as similar to the original design as possible. This is the "Stats Preview Card Component" challenge. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

### Design Replica
I first decided to not only replicate the design using HTML and CSS, but also replicate the design file in Figma, a tool used to design and prototype. I have added both the original designs and the design I recreated in Figma. Please feel free to compare them!

These are the final screenshots of the built page. I used HTML and SASS, a CSS preprocessor to build this site.  This is also the first time I have used SASS in a project, so feel free to provide any constructive criticism on how I can code better.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Since this is the first time I have tried to use SASS in my workflow, I was extremely intimidated by the various concepts such as Mixins and variables, but this also gave me an opportunity to practice and develop my skills with regards to not only mobile-first web design but also SASS.

### Continued development

I have only built it for 2 device breakpoints for now as that was the requirement, but I will surely be adding responsiveness across the entire available device spectrum.
